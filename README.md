# scout README

This is the README for VSCode extension "scout", a database client.

Intended to connect to various types of databases. This extension aims to provide developers with a unified interface to interact with different database systems directly within VSCode.

## Goals

- Connect to multiple database types (initial support TBD, more to come)
- Execute queries and view results within the editor
- Manage database connections easily
- Support for connection profiles
- Extensible architecture to add new database clients in the future
